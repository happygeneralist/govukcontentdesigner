# Content Design Rules

1. **User-Centered Design**  
   Focus on user needs at every step. Each piece of content should answer clear, identifiable user needs, ensuring that every word serves a purpose in helping the user achieve their goal.

2. **Clear and Simple Language**  
   - **Plain English**: Avoid jargon and complex language. Use plain English to ensure that all users, regardless of background, can understand the content. Avoid legal or technical terms unless absolutely necessary, and provide simple explanations when such terms are unavoidable.
   - **Concise and Direct**: Minimize words while maintaining clarity. Cut unnecessary information to keep the content as short as possible.

3. **Content Structure and Flow**  
   - **Linear and Logical**: The content should guide users step-by-step through the service or process. A clear flow helps users know where they are and what they need to do next.
   - **Break Down Complex Information**: Break down complex information into smaller, digestible parts, using headings, lists, and short paragraphs for readability.

4. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**  
   - **Follow Accessibility Guidelines**: Adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure the content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
   - **Inclusive Language**: Use inclusive and respectful language, avoiding assumptions about the audience’s background or abilities.

5. **Collaborative Content Development**  
   Content design should not be created in isolation. Designers should work collaboratively with UX professionals, developers, and stakeholders to ensure that both design and content are cohesive and user-focused.

6. **Consistency and Reusability**  
   Ensure content follows a consistent style and tone. Use GOV.UK's style manual to maintain a uniform tone across all content, which helps build user trust and ensures users don’t feel lost when navigating between pages.

7. **Feedback-Driven Improvements**  
   - **Iterative Testing**: Regularly gather feedback from users to test whether the content meets their needs. Adjust the content based on real-world testing and user feedback to improve clarity and usability.
   - **Content Design as an Ongoing Process**: Content should evolve based on user data and feedback. It is important to let go of initial assumptions and iteratively refine content for effectiveness.

8. **Data-Informed Content Decisions**  
   Use data and insights (e.g., analytics and user research) to inform content design decisions. Rather than guessing what users want, base content on actual user behavior and needs.

9. **Content Formats**  
   Use flexible content formats that can accommodate different needs, such as advice pieces or service responses. Ensure that content is designed to fit the user’s journey.

10. **Guidelines on Length and Focus**  
    Less is More: Aim to communicate the message in as few words as possible while maintaining clarity. Users often scan content, so keeping it short and to the point improves engagement.

11. **Iterative Design and Testing**  
    Content design should follow an iterative process. This involves defining user needs, designing content, testing it with real users, and making improvements based on feedback. Testing and user feedback are essential to ensure that content is fulfilling its intended purpose.

12. **Multichannel Accessibility**  
    Content should be designed to be consumed across multiple channels (web, mobile, print, etc.) in formats that suit the needs of diverse users. This means ensuring that content is accessible via various formats like video, tools, or interactive elements, depending on the user's preferences.

13. **Content Structuring Based on User’s Mental Model**  
    Structure content around the user’s mental model, not the organization’s. Ensure that the flow of information reflects how users think and process information, rather than internal workflows. This requires regular testing to validate that users can easily navigate and understand the structure.

14. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**  
    Collaboration between content designers, developers, and other experts (such as legal or policy advisors) is critical to producing effective content. Work together across teams to ensure that content is accurate, well-structured, and presented in the right format.

15. **Permission to Fail and Learn**  
    Give content teams the freedom to experiment and fail in the process of content creation. Allowing for public failure, followed by rapid iteration, helps teams refine their approach and ultimately produce better results.

16. **Content Formats and Tools**  
    Beyond just text, content should be designed in formats that best serve user needs, including tools like calculators, look-up systems, videos, and interactive guides. This flexibility ensures that users can interact with content in a manner that suits their individual preferences.

17. **Maintain Tone and Style Consistency**  
    While the tone of voice can adapt based on the communication channel (e.g., formal on the website, casual on social media), the style should remain consistent to preserve the brand’s integrity. Consistent style across different platforms helps avoid confusion.

18. **Content Lifecycle and Governance**  
    After content is published, it must be continuously monitored to ensure it still meets user needs. A governance process should be in place to manage updates and maintain content quality over time.

19. **Plain Language Doesn’t Mean Wordiness**  
    Avoid overcomplicating content by trying to explain too much. While plain language is vital, clarity and brevity are equally important. Content should remain concise, even when using plain English.

20. **Prioritize Readability**  
    - Use short sentences and paragraphs: GOV.UK emphasizes content that can be scanned and understood quickly. Each sentence should convey one idea, and paragraphs should be kept short.
    - Use subheadings to break down long text into manageable sections, allowing users to navigate the content more easily.

21. **Design for Accessibility**  
    - Use images, tools, and infographics only when they add value and always provide alternative text or accessible versions. Content should not rely on images alone to communicate essential information.
    - Ensure content is usable with assistive technology like screen readers, and keep in mind that some users cannot "glance" at content, so navigation should be intuitive and structured with clear headings.

22. **Test and Iterate**  
    Content should not be a "write once and forget" approach. Regular testing, user feedback, and iteration based on data analytics are core to maintaining content that meets user needs effectively.

23. **Consistency Across Channels**  
    Ensure that messaging is consistent across various platforms (e.g., websites, emails, social media) so that users receive a coherent experience. Inconsistent messaging can confuse users and erode trust.

24. **Content Governance**  
    Establish clear workflows for content creation, including roles for writers, editors, subject-matter experts, and designers. A central content strategy helps maintain quality, accountability, and ensures content is timely, accurate, and user-centered.

25. **Use Data and Evidence**  
    Ensure that content decisions are always evidence-based, using analytics and user feedback to validate user needs. This approach helps prioritize the most valuable content for users.

26. **Minimize Cognitive Load**  
    - Keep the cognitive effort low by simplifying language, content layout, and visual design. Users should not have to think too hard to understand the information.
    - Provide tools and calculators where appropriate to simplify complex tasks rather than explaining them in long paragraphs.

27. **Avoid Duplication**  
    Avoid creating duplicate content across different government websites or services. Centralize information and ensure it is relevant to the user's current needs.

28. **Inclusive and Neutral Language**  
    Use gender-neutral and inclusive language. Ensure that content is respectful of diverse audiences, avoiding any assumptions about the user’s background.

29. **Focus on User Journeys**  
    Structure content according to the natural flow of the user’s journey, keeping in mind the stages a user goes through when interacting with the service. This may include decision points, actions, or next steps.
